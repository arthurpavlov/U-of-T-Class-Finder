# Product Name: UofT course route planner / Team Name: CSC301 Team 03

#### Q1: What are you planning to build?
We are planning to build an Android app that can help UofT students to find their way to classrooms based on their course schedule (St.George campus). Our product takes the course schedule as an input, and calculate the best route for a student to go between classes, including the route inside the building. The main purpose of our product is to help students who are not familiar with the campus find their classroom easily.

#### Q2: Who are your target users?
Main target users are U of T St.G students, since the application will help the students to plan the route according to the daily schedule from ACORN. Besides this, there may be extra functionality that visitors of U of T can use to search for their destination from their location on campus.

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?
Right now the simplest way of finding a UofT building is to log into ACORN to check the building abbreviation first, followed by searching the building full name on UofT Map website by its abbreviation, which gives the physical location on the map. However, if the user wants dynamic navigation, they would need to open Google/Apple Map to enter the full building name(since Google/Apple won't recognize the abbreviation). What is currently in production and being used by UofT students requires too much effort and leads to a bad user experience. As a UofT student, he or she may sometimes be tired of this redundant but inevitable work. For U of T students who have a compact daily schedule, spending time looking for classrooms make it hard to get an ideal seat and it may even lead to partially missing lecture. 

### Highlights

- We decide to implement an android app instead of a website, since a student will be much more likely to use a cell phone to get the route rather than open a website on the computer.

- We might implement the function of notification, giving user an alert when it comes the time of setting off, but we are considering the potential for annoyance with notifications

- We might implement some side functions such as directing the student to the nearest subway station, which is a practical tool for commuters.

- We also came up with the idea of food truck order, which let students order in advance and save their time of lining up and waiting for food preparation.

- We are trying to set up a scrum project pattern, planning the sprints for two weeks and having a scrum meeting every two days.

- In general, we want to integrate our application into the daily flow of the average UofT student, allowing them to efficiently and easily navigate to their classes
