 * End date: March 11th

## Process

## Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: March 10th
 * Where: In-person, BA3200
 
## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well
 
Successful proccess-related decisions:
 1. Github workflow: 
    * Near the end of our sprint we did end up needing to push directly to master in order to complete our objectives and that came with some stability issues, with our Github structure implemented early, we didn't run into these issues, highlighting the importance that our chosen structure had from start to finish
    * That being said, the exception to the rule in our structure allowed us to meet our desired goal for this iteration
 2. Task assignment:
    * Assigning tasks to groups/individuals proved to be useful in progress for the most part, we each had targets of development which allowed us to contribute more easily

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

Less successful process-related decisions:
 1. Task specification:
    * When assigning tasks we decided on assignments that were too vague resulting an inaccurate determination of work and complexity.
 2. Task assignment logistics:
    * We hadn't decided on a tool for tracking task assignments and our assignments became fairly ad-hoc by the end of the development period. 
 3. Schedule artifact
    * We planned to track tasks on a schedule as well to keep ourselves organized but the overhead of this tracking ended up being too much given our workload.

#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 1. Task assignment adjustments
    * We'll be deciding on a singular place for task assignments and tracking
    * All addition tasks and issues will be brought up and tracked in that location (likely Discord)

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:
 
 1. Completed the core features planned for this iteration - See demo video
    * We completed almost all of the features we wanted to complete (in our iteration 02 plan) for this iteration, and demostrated them all on the video
 2. Framework for persistent data and Google API data was set up
    * Our backend was set up properly to handle persistent data and web requests
    * See example request to public address: http://165.227.34.218/buildings/BA
 3. Video creation and editing process
    * Even With none of us being experienced in video editing, the video creation process went smoothly thanks to the efforts of our team members
    * See demo video

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 1. User interface
    * We ran out of time to implement the UI to our target levels by the end of the iteration since we were focused on getting the functionality of the app to work. 
    * And so, we would like to improve our UI for the next iteration
    
 2. Dynamic route display based on time
    * This was another feature that went under for this iteration due to time constraints on our development
    
 3. User workflow improvements via notification bar
    * This feature wasn't planned for this iteration but going into the next one, we definitely want to work on this improvement.

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

 1. Adjustments to development structure based on needs
    For the next iteration we may need to divide up the teams differently and more fluidly to properly distribute the work. Since UI will likely be the focus for the next one, we'll need to put more resources on that front.
    
 2. Development structure
    We ran into issues on Git with Android files and that caused slowdown and blockages in our development. Now that things have been more or less cleared up, our focus for our development structure will be more rules based (with branches and commits), and more strictly enforced.
