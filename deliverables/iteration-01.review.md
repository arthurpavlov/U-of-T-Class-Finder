## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: February 8th
 * Where: BA, Discord channel


## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:


-	We managed find a project idea from existing problem. We also researched if this problem has been already solved. Out of unsolved ideas, We decided to make an Android app that can help U of T students to find their way to classrooms based on their course schedule (St.George campus).
-	After discussing which platform we are going build on, we decided to build an Android App.
-	Decided on meeting structure. We used When2Meet website to find out the time slot that is available for everyone.
	https://www.when2meet.com/?6638284-E1vMl
	We had team meetings using the information from this schedule.
	Also our team made Discord channel, so we can do the meeting online too.
-	Decided development roles of team members. Every single person in the group will be responsible for part of the project. We divided the work equally. We also nominated one of the members to be the meeting recorder, so we can keep track of what we discuss every meeting.




#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:
- We have not set up the github sturcture for our product. It has not been done yet, because researching about the product and gathering up the ideas took longer than we expected. It is to be done as soon as possible for next iteration.
-	We have not decided which additional features we are going to implement yet, because we spent more time to find an existing problem to solve. We have few ideas about the additional features, but we will try to flesh them out in an in-depth discussion at the start of the next iteration.

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

- Learn basic ideas and techniques of developing in Android Studio, scheduling building steps of our project
- Design and work on building user interface of the classroom finding problem we would like to address
- Practise and do research on tools and skills we may need in order to implement our ideas and in order to determine whether what we want is doable or useful
- May update our idea and add more features based on the research result
